## Materials Needed For the Application
To use the application, you will need the following:
1. The **Raw Data** from Microsoft Forms in an excel sheet (.xlsx). The sheet the raw data is on should be titled "RawData"
2. The **Answer Sheet** in an excel sheet (.xlsx). The sheet that the Answer Sheet is on should be titled "AnswerSheet"

_Note: The raw data and the answer sheet can be on the same .xlsx if you would like. Just ensure that the individual sheets are titled appropriately_ 

3. A **destination folder** for the output. This is where your files will be located once the application is finished running -- just use your file manager of choice (e.g. Finder, File Explorer) to make the folder in your desired location.
